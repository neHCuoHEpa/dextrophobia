"FAQ"

Q. The track has come off the wheels.

A1. Attach the "Wheel Resize Script" to the wheels.
    When the wheels are too small, they often go through the track at the opening of PlayMode.
    Select the "Create_###Wheel" and enable the "Wheel Resize Script" in the Inspector window.
    And set the "Scale Size" to greater than 1.
    When the wheels are too big and they protrude from the track, set the "Scale Size" to smaller than 1.
    The wheels are resized to the specified scale at the opening of PlayMode.
    And they return gently to the original size.
    
    
    

A2. Use the "Soft_Landing".
    If the track has been off by falling to the ground at the opening of PlayMode, try to use the "Soft_Landing" option.
    Select the "MainBody" and enable the "Soft Landing" in the Inspector window.
    The tank can quietly fall down and gently land on the ground.
    
A3. Make sure the 'Solver Iteration Count'.
    Select the "MainBody" and confirm the 'Solver Iteration Count' in the Inspector window.
    Physics_Track is apt to stretch when this value is set low.

A4. Adjust the number of track pieces.
    When the track is too tight or too loose, adjust the number of the track pieces.
    You can adjust the number of the pieces by one piece, adjusting the "Angle of Front Arc" and "Angle of Rear Arc".

A5. Adjust the "Spacing" value.
    The "Spacing" value in the "Create_TrackBelt" should be same as the length of the piece.
    However you may adjust it just a little.


Q. Can I use other game pad?

A. Please modify the "Input Manager".
    The "Input Manager" is set for 'Xbox 360' controller.
    When you use other gamepad, you might have to modify the "Input Manager".
    Please refer to the following 'Wiki'.
    http://wiki.etc.cmu.edu/unity3d/index.php/Joystick/Controller
    I can use my 'Play Station 3" controller with using 'Xbox 360 Controller Emulator' of 'MotioninJoy'.


Q. How to increase the tank speed?

A1. Increase the "Torque" and "Maximum Speed" values.
    Select the "MainBody", and increase the "Torque" and "Maximum Speed" values in the 'Drive_Control_CS (Script)'.

A2. Decrease the "Fixed Timestep" value.
    The motion of the RigidBody is more accurately calculated when the "Fixed Timestep" value is decreased. 
    However this way is much increase the stress of the processor. Perhaps you can smoothly drive only one tank in the scene.
    You can change the value in the "Game_Controller" in the scene.
    And increase the "Torque" and "Maximum Speed" values in the MainBody.
 
A3. Increase the "Time Scale" value.
    The speed of the time passing can be changed in the "Game_Controller" in the scene.
    If you feel that the motion of the tank is too quick, weaken the gravity of the scene.
    The gravity value can be also adjusted in the "Game_Controller".
