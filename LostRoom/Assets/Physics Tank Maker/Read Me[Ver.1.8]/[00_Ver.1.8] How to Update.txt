*** How to update old tanks (from Ver.1.7 to Ver.1.8) ***

(1) Replace the "CrossHair" in the tank.
    Delete the old "CrossHair" in the tank, and attach the new "CrossHair" in the "Template" folder to the tank.
    (Notice.)
    Make sure that the "CrossHair" is placed just under the top object.
   

(2) Set the "Marker Prefab" in the "Turret_Base".
    You can find the prefab named "Marker_01" in the "Template" folder.
    Drag and drop it to the "Marker Prefab"  in the "Turret_Base".
   

(3) Set the "Recoil Force" in the "Cannon_Base".
   

(4) Remove the "Recoil_Generator" in the tank.
    Delete the "Recoil_Generator" under the "Cannon_Base".
   

(5) Remove the Lights in the tank.
    Delete the Lights under the "Look_At_Point".
    
    (Notice.) Please set more than one the light in the scene.

(6) Engine sound settings.
    The calculation method of the engine sound has been changed in Ver.1.8.
    When the tank has physics tracks, adjust the "Max Speed" value of the "Sound_Control_CS" in the "Create_###Wheel".
   

(7) Driving behavior settings.
    New options are added for the realistic behavior.
    When the tank turns too easily or hardly, adjust the following values of the "Drive_Control_CS" in the "MainBody"
   
    [Lost Brake Drag Rate]
    The rate that the "Turn Brake Drag" is reduced when the tank runs at maximum speed.
    (Notice.)
    "Turn Brake Drag" is reduced in proportion to the tank speed by this script.
    When the tank turns too easily, decrease this value.

    [Lost Speed Rate]
    The rate that the tank speed is reduced per second while the tank is turning using turn brake.
    (Notice.)
    The speed of the tank is reduced while doing brake turn by this script.
    When the tank turns too slowly, decrease this value.

(8) Other settings.
    In the new sample scenes, the "Time Scale" value is set to "1.0", and "Gravity" value is set to "-9.81".
    If you need, increase the "Sus Spring Force" value in the "Create_RoadWheel".


*** How to update old scene (from Ver.1.7 to Ver.1.8) ***
