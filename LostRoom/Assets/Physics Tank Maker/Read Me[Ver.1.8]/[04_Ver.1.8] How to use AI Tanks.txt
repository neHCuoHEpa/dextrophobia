(Warning.)
This AI system requires Navigation Meshes (NavMesh) in the scene.
When the NavMesh has not been baked for the scene, you will get errors in PlayMode.
In the sample scenes, the NavMeshes are already prepared.

You can find finished AI tank prefabs in the "Resources" >> "Sample_Tank_1.8" >> "AI".


(1) Drag and drop the prefab into the Hierarchy window.
   
(2) Select the top object of the tank (such as 'KV-I') in the Hierarchy window.

(3) Choose the "Tank ID" differing from other tanks in the Inspector window.
   
    (Notice.) You can skip this step.

(4) Choose the "Relationship".
    Choose the relationship with other AI tanks.
   

(5) Make sure that the "Input Device Type" is set to "AI".
   

(6) Select the "AI_Core" in the tank.
   

(7) Set the "WayPoint Pack" fitting for the scene.
   
    You can find "WayPoint_Pack" in the scene or in the "Template" folder.
    (Notice.) When the "WayPoint Pack" is not assigned, the tank tries to stay in its initial position.

(8) Select the top object of the tank, and adjust the position.
   

(9) Now you are ready to play.
    (Notice.)
    You can modify AI's behavior much more.
    Please read the reference text "AI_System".
