(Notice.)
Tank prefabs must be placed under the "Resources" folder for using Respawn function.


(Notice.)
The tank is respawned in the state of its prefab even when you changed its settings in EditMode.
To respawn the tank having the new settings, create a new prefab for it, or overwrite the prefab (not recommended).

(1) Select the top object of tank in the Hierarchy window.
   

(2) Break the prefab connection when the name is displayed in blue.
    ( 'Game Object' >> 'Break Prefab Instance' )
   

(3) Change the name.
    (Notice.) Give the name different from other prefabs.
   

(4) Drag and drop it into the "Resources" folder, or into the folder under the "Resources" folder.
   

(5) Select the tank in the Hierarchy window again.
   

(6) Make sure that the path of the prefab is indicated in the Inspector window.
   

(7) Press the "Apply" button to update the prefab.
   

(8) Test in PlayMode.
    Make sure that the tank can be respawned having the new settings.
    (Notice.)
    You can respawn the tank in the scene by pressing "Enter(Return)" key.
    When you want to reset the scene, press "Back Space" key.
