*** How to start ***
(1) Create a new project, and import this package from Asset Store.
    Window >> AssetStore >> Import this package from 'Download Manager'.
    
(2) Open the Sample Scene.
    File >> Open Scene >> 'Physics Tank Maker' >> 'Sample_Scene' >> "Base_1.8.unity".
    You can also open the scene double-clicking it in the Project browser.

(3) It's ready to play.
    Click the "Play" button.


*** Modify the 'Input Manager' ***
You can also use 'Xbox360 controller' by customizing the "Input Manager" settings.
Please modify the "Input Manager" settings in the following ways.

(Notice.)
In order to copy and paste the files, use your File Browser such as 'Explorer' and 'Finder'.
    
(1) Unzip and Copy the setting file.
    You can find a ZIP-file named "InputManager.zip" in the 'ReadMe[Ver.1.8]' folder.
    'Your project name' >> 'Assets' >> 'Physics_Tank_Maker'  >> 'ReadMe[Ver.1.8]'
    Unzip the "InputManager.zip" and copy the "InputManager.asset".
   

(2) Paste the "InputManager.asset" into the 'ProjectSettings' folder.
    'Your project name' >> 'ProjectSettings'
    You can find the current "InputManager.asset".
    Paste the new "InputManager.asset" and overwrite it.
   


(3) Confirm that the "Input Manager" has been updated.
    Edit >> Project Settings >> Input
    If it was successful, you can find new Axes "Horizontal2", "Vertical2", "L_Button", "R_Button", "L_Trigger", "R_Trigger" in the Inspector window.
   

(4) Now you can choose the "Input Device Type".
    Select the top object of a tank such as 'Tiger-I' and 'KV-I' in the Hierarchy window.
    You can find the "Tank_ID_Control_CS(Script)" and its options in the Inspector window.
    Choose the "Input Device Type" except for the "AI".
